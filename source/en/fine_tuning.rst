.. _initialization_method:

The initialization methods
*****************************

Here is the process, when atoum executes the test methods of a class with the default engine (``concurrent``) :

#. call of the ``setUp()`` method from the tested class ;
#. launch of a PHP sub-process for **each** test method ;
#. in the PHP sub-process, call of the ``beforeTestMethod()`` method of the test class ;
#. in the PHP sub-process, call of the test method ;
#. in the PHP sub-process, call of the ``afterTestMethod()`` method of the test class ;
#. once the PHP sub-process finished, call of the ``tearDown()`` method from thze test class.

.. note::
   For more information on the execution engine of test in atoum, you can read the section about the annotation :ref:`@engine <@engine>`.

The methods ``setUp()`` and ``tearDown()`` allow respectively to initialize and clean up the test environment for all the test method of the running class.

The methods ``beforeTestMethod()`` and ``afterTestMethod()`` allows respectively to initialize and clean up the execution environment of the individual tests for all test method of the class. Since they are executed in the same subprocess, in contrast of ``setUp()`` and ``tearDown()``.

It's also the reason why the methods  ``beforeTestMethod()`` and ``afterTestMethod()`` accept as argument the name of the test method executed, in order to adjust the treatment accordingly.

   <?php
   namespace vendor\project\tests\units;

   use
       mageekguy\atoum,
       vendor\project
   ;

   require __DIR__ . '/mageekguy.atoum.phar';

   class bankAccount extends atoum
   {
       public function setUp()
       {
           // Executed *before all* test methods.
           // global initialization.
       }

       public function beforeTestMethod($method)
       {
           // Executed *before each* test method.

           switch ($method)
           {
               case 'testGetOwner':
                   // Initialization for testGetOwner().
               break;

               case 'testGetOperations':
                   // Initialization for testGetOperations().
               break;
           }
       }

       public function testGetOwner()
       {
           ...
       }

       public function testGetOperations()
       {
           ...
       }

       public function afterTestMethod($method)
       {
           // Executed *after each* test method.

           switch ($method)
           {
               case 'testGetOwner':
                   // Cleaning for testGetOwner().
               break;

               case 'testGetOperations':
                   // Cleaning for testGetOperations().
               break;
           }
       }

       public function tearDown()
       {
           // Executed after all the test methods.
           // Overall cleaning.
       }
   }

By default, the ``setUp()``, ``beforeTestMethod()``, ``afterTestMethod()`` and ``tearDown()`` methods does absolutely nothing.

It is therefore the responsibility of the programmer to overload when needed in the test classes concerned.
